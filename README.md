## Functionality üöÄ

### Directory Selection

When the user clicks the **Select Directory** button, a folder selection dialog opens. If the user selects a directory, the directory label displays the selected path, and the file list updates with the files from the directory, excluding folders and file types specified in the filters.

### File Search

The search textbox allows the user to search for files by name. As the user types in the search textbox, the file list updates to show only the files that match the search text.

### Folder and File Type Filters

The folder filters textbox allows the user to enter folder names to exclude from the file list. The file type filters textbox allows the user to enter file extensions (e.g., `.txt`, `.jpg`) to include in the file list.

### Output Location Selection

The **Select Output Location** button opens a save file dialog allowing the user to select the location and name of the output file. The output location label displays the selected path.

### Output File Generation

The **Generate Output** button generates an output file at the selected location. The output file contains the path and content of each selected file in the list. The progress bar shows the progress of the output file generation.

## Usage üìã

1. Run the script in PowerShell.
2. Select a directory by clicking the **Select Directory** button.
3. Optionally, enter folder and file type filters in the respective textboxes.
4. Search for specific files using the search textbox.
5. Select the output file location by clicking the **Select Output Location** button.
6. Generate the output file by clicking the **Generate Output** button.

## Requirements ‚öôÔ∏è

- PowerShell
- .NET Framework (to use Windows Forms classes)

## Notes üìù

- The script uses the `System.Windows.Forms` class to create the user interface.
- The generated output file includes both the path and the content of each selected file, separated by double newlines.
- This tool is especially useful for developers who want to seamlessly pass their code files to ChatGPT, enhancing their workflow and enabling smoother new chat sessions.

Enjoy a streamlined workflow with your code files and ChatGPT! üíªü§ñ
